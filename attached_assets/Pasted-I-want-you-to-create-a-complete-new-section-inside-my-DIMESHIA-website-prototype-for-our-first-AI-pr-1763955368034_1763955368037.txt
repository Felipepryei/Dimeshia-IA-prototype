I want you to create a complete new section inside my DIMESHIA website prototype for our first AI product:

DIMESHIA AMAO – Automated Model Analysis & Optimization

This section must look ultra-modern, premium, and professional — like a real AI startup website.
Use clean layout, soft shadows, gradients, rounded corners, and a minimal futuristic 3D-tech style.

Add this entire section as a NEW part of the website without deleting existing content. It must be easy to edit later.

1. Hero Section (Header Block)

Create a hero block with:

Title:
AMAO – Automated Model Analysis & Optimization

Subtitle:
Let AI instantly detect modeling issues, optimize topology, and clean your 3D files.

Button:
"Try the Simulation"

This hero must look visually impressive.

2. Feature Grid (4 Premium Feature Cards)

Create a responsive grid with 4 cards, each with an icon placeholder:

⭕ Model Health Score

AI rates your model from 0–100 and highlights structural problems.

🔺 Ngon & Topology Detection

Detects ngons, bad geometry, dense areas, flipped normals, and mesh errors.

🧩 Polygon Optimization

Suggests optimized poly counts while preserving silhouette and animation readiness.

📦 Clean Pipeline Export

Auto-prepares the model for Blender, Maya, Unreal, Unity, and more.

Each card should have:

icon placeholder

title

short description

clean UI (rounded corners, shadow, hover effect)

3. Simulation Preview (Fake Demo UI)

Add a section titled:

“See AMAO in Action”

With this description:

Upload a 3D model and let AMAO automatically analyze topology health, UVs, ngons, and optimization opportunities. See an instant report powered by AI.

Include a visual mockup with simple UI boxes:

Box: “Upload .fbx / .obj”

Box: “Analyzing your model…” with animated placeholder

Box: “Results Preview”

Health Score mockup (ex: 82/100)

Ngon count mockup

UV coverage mockup

Suggested optimization steps mockup

Make this section look like a real AI product preview.

4. Call-to-Action Footer

Add a full-width CTA:

Title:
Launch AMAO Beta — Join the Waitlist

Include:

an email input field

a “Join Waitlist” button

Make it visually strong and centere
