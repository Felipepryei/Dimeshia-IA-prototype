Create a fully-responsive, futuristic LIVE DEMO UI for DIMESHIA in the “Watch Live Demo” CTA — an AI agency that automates repetitive 3D tasks and optimizes pipelines for artists and studios.

This demo should NOT showcase rendering or product visuals.  
Instead, simulate how DIMESHIA automates full 3D workflows exactly like a real production tool.

The experience must feel like a REAL AI engine scanning, analyzing, fixing, and preparing 3D assets.

────────────────────────────
### SECTION 1 — REAL-TIME MODEL SCAN & VALIDATION
Create a fake "3D Scan Simulation" screen:
- Rotating wireframe silhouette (no real model)
- Pulsing scan lines sweeping vertically
- Diagnostic HUD overlays
- Animated mesh grid distortion to simulate analysis

Simulate the following checks with progress bars:
1. Model Intake & Validation  
2. Checking topology  
3. Detecting ngons  
4. Detecting scale inconsistencies  
5. Detecting naming errors

Each check should have:
- Micro-animations  
- Green checkmarks when complete  
- Warnings that flash yellow before being auto-fixed  

Visual style: Like Unreal Engine + NVIDIA Omniverse diagnostics.

────────────────────────────
### SECTION 2 — AUTOMATIC MESH CLEANUP (AI FIX MODULE)
Show DIMESHIA fixing the issues automatically.

Simulate:
- Removing ngons (animated topology preview lines)
- Rebuilding geometry (lines reorganizing like a neural net)
- Auto-retopology simulation (mesh density drops visually)
- Smoothing normals (soft glow pulse)

Represent changes with:
- “BEFORE → AFTER” meters
- Topology heatmaps shifting from red → green
- Speed meters (“Processing at 11.5M ops/sec”)

────────────────────────────
### SECTION 3 — UV & TEXTURE WORKFLOW AUTOMATION
Simulate a UV automation screen with:
- Fake UV islands sliding into place
- UDIM tiles lighting up in sequence (1001 → 1010)
- Packing animation with elastic transitions

Show automated steps:
- Auto UV unwrap  
- UDIM layout generation  
- UV packing optimization  
- Detecting + fixing overlapping UVs  

Make it visually satisfying — like a puzzle snapping together.

────────────────────────────
### SECTION 4 — PIPELINE INTEGRATION & EXPORT
Simulate DIMESHIA preparing the asset for delivery.

Steps:
1. Folder structure auto-generation  
2. Auto renaming using naming conventions  
3. Format conversions:
   - FBX → GLB → USDZ (smooth animated icon transitions)
4. Missing texture scan (flash red → auto resolved)

Next:  
Show “AI Pipeline Brain” — a flowing neural graph connecting tasks in real time.

────────────────────────────
### SECTION 5 — RENDER PIPELINE PREP
Show cinematic automation UI:

- Auto light rig setup (icons of lights appear in sequence)
- Auto camera presets (UI overlays switch lenses)
- Scene organization (layers snapping into categories)

Everything must feel FAST, SMART, and AUTOMATIC.

────────────────────────────
### SECTION 6 — FLOWCHART VIEW (FUTURISTIC)
Create a “Flowchart View” that lights up each step as the pipeline runs:

[SCAN] → [CLEANUP] → [UV] → [EXPORT] → [RENDER PREP]

Each box should:
- Glow neon blue when active  
- Pulse purple when completed  
- Draw animated nodes connecting steps  

This must feel like a real AI system at work.

────────────────────────────
### SECTION 7 — FINAL SUMMARY SCREEN
End with a professional SaaS-style report screen:

- “Workflow Acceleration: +63% Faster Production”
- “Tasks Automated: 17”
- “Errors Fixed: 42”
- “Exported Formats: FBX, GLB, USDZ”
- CTA Button: “Download Pipeline Report” (fake button)

────────────────────────────
### DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Dark futuristic UI  
- Blue & purple neon accents  
- Glassmorphism panels  
- Smooth micro-interactions  
- Fast, elegant transitions  
- Premium AI SaaS look
- Code must be fully in **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**
- No backend  
- Entire pipeline is simulated visually  

────────────────────────────

Goal:  
Make DIMESHIA feel like a **real AI automation platform**, trusted by 3D artists and studios, capable of handling entire production pipelines automatically.
