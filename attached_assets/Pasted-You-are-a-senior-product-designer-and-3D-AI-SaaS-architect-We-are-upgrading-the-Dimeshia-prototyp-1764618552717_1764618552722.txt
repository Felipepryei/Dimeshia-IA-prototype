You are a senior product designer and 3D AI SaaS architect. 
We are upgrading the Dimeshia prototype inside Replit to look like a real, high-end SaaS product.
The core product of Dimeshia is AMAO (Automated Model Analysis & Optimization), an AI tool that:
- analyzes 3D model quality (polygon count, n-gons, ngons, topology issues)
- automatically reduces polygon count while preserving detail
- generates clean UVs for texturing
- exports optimized downloadable models for 3D pipelines (Unity, Unreal, Maya, Blender)

Your task right now:
Create a new section in the landing page called "AMAO Live Demo Preview" with the goal of building credibility through visual proof.

Requirements for this section:
1. It must include at least one realistic product demo visualization using:
   - a 3D interactive model preview using Three.js or Spline 3D export, OR
   - an optimized 3D model before/after showcase animation (GIF or looping video),
   - plus an analysis card showing simulated results: polycount reduced, issues detected, UVs generated.

2. Visual structure:
   - Headline: "See AMAO in Action"
   - Subheadline: "Upload a model → get instant QA, topology fixes, UVs and optimized export-ready assets"
   - One main button CTA: "Try AMAO Analysis (Beta)" that visually reacts when hovered/clicked.

3. Content to include (as simulated demo):
   - A side by side preview labeled:
        "Original Model (45,230 Polygons, N-gons detected)"
        "Optimized by AMAO (12,870 Polygons, Clean Topology, Auto UVs)"
   - A results card showing simulated output stats with icons:
        ✔ Polygon reduction preserved details  
        ✔ N-gons fixed  
        ✔ UVs generated  
        ✔ Model optimized for texturing and engines  

4. Style guidelines:
   - Minimal, premium, modern, tech aesthetic
   - Dark UI, neon accent teal or green, clean typography
   - Rounded containers, soft glow around 3D preview
   - Responsive layout for desktop + mobile
   - No long paragraphs, concise impactful copy

5. Optional but valuable:
   - If possible, integrate a rotating 3D viewer inside the section using:
        - Three.js GLTF viewer
        - or an embedded Spline scene
        - or a Spline 3D iframe export
   - The preview must not identify any real person or brand that could cause copyright issues.

Outcome:
The section must feel real and visually prove how AMAO optimizes 3D models, even if the results are simulated for beta credibility.
Return the final code or component structure ready to paste into Replit using JavaScript/React/HTML.
