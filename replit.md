# DIMESHIA Brand Identity Showcase

## Overview
This project is a high-end brand identity showcase for DIMESHIA, an AI automation agency specializing in 3D production pipelines. Built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, its purpose is to demonstrate DIMESHIA's capabilities in 3D AI optimization and automated studio pipelines through interactive and visually rich demonstrations. The project aims to attract leading 3D studios and creative agencies by showcasing innovative solutions and a futuristic aesthetic.

## User Preferences
- Wants to showcase Buoy Model in Experience Our Technology section
- Prefers to see real 3D models with optimization statistics displayed

## System Architecture
The application is a frontend-only, static showcase built with React 18.3.1, Vite 5.4.2, and TypeScript 5.5.3. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS 3.4.1. 3D graphics are handled by Three.js, integrated via `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`. The UI/UX features a high-tech, futuristic aesthetic with a clean, minimal interface, incorporating gradient overlays, blur effects, and animations.

**Key Features:**
- **Automated Studio Pipeline Demo**: A real-time, interactive demonstration of a 6-stage 3D production workflow, featuring a realistic 3D character model, dynamic metrics, and professional UI elements (e.g., glassmorphism, neon accents). It simulates processes like Model Scan & Validation, Mesh Cleanup (AI Fix Module), UV & Texture Workflow, Pipeline Integration & Export, and Render Pipeline Prep, culminating in a Final Summary Report.
- **AI 3D Optimization Tool**: An interactive tool allowing simulated upload and optimization of 3D models (OBJ, GLB, GLTF, FBX), displaying before/after comparisons and real-time optimization statistics (polygon count, mesh count, material count).
- **Interactive Color System**: A clickable color palette for easy value copying.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with smooth animations.
- **SVG Logo**: Programmatically generated hexagonal logo.
- **Professional Pricing Section**: A 4-tier pricing model with glassmorphism design and interactive elements.
- **AMAO Product Launch**: Showcasing Automated Model Analysis & Optimization with an 8-stage interactive pipeline, live results dashboard, and AI-recommended fixes.

**Design Principles:**
- High-tech aesthetic with AI/3D focus, futuristic workspace simulations.
- Clean, minimal interface with gradient overlays and blur effects.
- **Color Palette**: Primary Electric Blue (#3B82F6), Accent Violet (#8B5CF6), Neutral Black to White grayscale.
- **Typography**: Inter (Google Fonts) with weights 400-900.
